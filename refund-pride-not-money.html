        <h1>Refund pride, not money</h1>
        <p><i>Note:</i> I originally wrote this piece on August 29th, 2011, the day after Arsenal’s awful 2-8 away defeat at Manchester United. I wrote it in one go, very quickly, somehow I knew exactly what I wanted to say. Today, its overall argument still rings true to me.</p>
        <p class="small">¶</p>
        <p>On Sunday, <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/match/report/1112/post/first-team/premier-league-man-utd-8-2-arsenal-report">Arsenal played badly and lost heavily</a>. Arsenal’s away supporters at Old Trafford, in contrast, were amazing. I was watching the game on television, and I could hear the away block singing and chanting throughout the second half—despite a harrowing scoreline.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Arsenal as a club—not, notably, the players specifically—<a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/arsenal-thanks">offered all these fantastic away fans the opportunity to pay for a future away match ticket in the Premier League</a>. Technically, this is not a direct refund for the Manchester debacle; but, effectively, it is.</p>
        <p>A gesture is a formal action (of the body) to express and emphasise a feeling. And Arsenal’s gesture wants to say: sorry!</p>
        <p>As a gesture, this shows good intent. (And a welcome one for the individual fans). However, in a wider sense, especially considering some of the accompanying commentary in the media and on twitter, I am worried that the reasoning behind the gesture sends out a bad signal.</p>
        <p>Losing a game, even losing heavily, is part of a supporter’s life. As Nick Hornby once said, ‘the natural state of the football fan is bitter disappointment, no matter what the score’.</p>
        <p>Suffering with, for and because of the club is the dividing line between liking a club and belonging to a club. You can only fully appreciate a 1-0 league title win at Old Trafford if you are prepared to accept an 8-2 humiliation at Old Trafford. The highs and lows of football fandom are mutually dependent. If you cherry-pick only the good results, you are not a supporter.</p>
        <p>Buying an admittedly expensive stadium ticket does not buy you a win for your team or even a good performance; it just buys you attendance. And as Hornby has warned you, buying a match ticket may buy you bitter disappointment. You know this risk in advance.</p>
        <p>To be sure, there are exceptional reasons for a refund: if, against expectation, several regular starters were unreasonably rested, or if the players obviously did not try to perform (like being on a strike).</p>
        <p>Both criteria did not apply to the Arsenal game. Several first-teamers were missing, but due to suspension or injury; none were rested. And although the players on the pitch performed poorly, they did try.</p>
        <p>In the end, what bothers me most about the refund story is a conflation of the roles of customer and supporter. (This also bothers me most about some of the media or twitter comments I have been reading, demanding a refund as a ‘right’ of the disappointed football fan).</p>
        <p>It is only a customer who can claim a refund for a below-par performance against expectation. A supporter, however, cannot claim such a right to lost money—only a right to lost pride.</p>
        <p>As I have said, Arsenal meant the refund gesture well. But it is a telling gesture, for it treats the suffering Old Trafford away fans as customers rather than supporters. Arsenal’s gesture refunds their money, not their pride.</p>
        <p>The only true measure of how Arsenal can ‘refund’ the pride of their fans is on the pitch, in the next game(s). Of course, that cannot be guaranteed.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Arsenal—and the players in particular—could have considered a more meaningful gesture to appease their supporters: for example, by engaging more with them and listening to their concerns on an extra open day.</p>
        <p>(Even during an international break there are always some injured or unselected players left behind; even a few players would have sufficed for an ad-hoc fan event).</p>
        <p>One of the core problems in contemporary professional football is the increasingly lost connection between players and supporters. They live in separate spheres, with only virtualised or mediated contact between them through television or internet—and even, to some degree, inside stadiums.</p>
        <p>Arsenal have missed an opportunity here to re-establish some real connection: specifically in the case of the Manchester away support, but also more generally with regard to all Arsenal supporters.</p>
        <p>It is not a big, burning issue; but it highlights a wider problem. Perhaps another time. There always is another time. This will not be the last Arsenal defeat, nor the heaviest. In football, the suffering never ends! *smile*</p>
