        <h1>Write better without adverbs</h1>
        <p>‘Writing is easy. All you have to do is cross out the wrong words.’ Mark Twain said.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>We think and speak in fragments, not full sentences: </p>
        <p>‘So, erm, John, my friend, he bought a car, and, you know, it has a blue colour.’</p>
        <p>Average writers tidy it up a little: </p>
        <p>‘John, my friend, bought a car, which has a blue colour.’</p>
        <p>Good writers go for efficiency:</p>
        <p>‘My friend John bought a blue car.’</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Good writing has high information density, without reading dense. </p>
        <p>Maximum info in minimum words, while sounding human.</p>
        <p>It’s an art. Nobody’s perfect at it.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Writers sell words. Readers buy them in a currency called attention.</p>
        <p>If words don’t offer value, readers won’t pay attention and stop reading.</p>
        <p>Value can be business or pleasure. People read to learn or be entertained. The best writing combines both.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Scientists have a natural advantage over novelists: real-world facts already contain valuable information.</p>
        <p>The challenge is to find the essence and eliminate the fluff.</p>
        <p>Many overwrite their papers with empty words.</p>
        <p>Picture a math prof who wants to say 1+1=2 but writes: </p>
        <p>(1+0)+(1+0)=2+(0+0)</p>
        <p>Don’t be that writer.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <h2>Delete Adverbs</h2>
        <p>Stephen King:</p>
        <p>‘The road to hell is paved with adverbs.’</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Adverbs are modifiers of verbs.</p>
        <p>In the sentence ‘I run slowly’, the adverb ‘slowly’ modifies the verb ‘run’.</p>
        <p>Most adverbs end with -ly. But not all: ‘I run fast.’</p>
        <p>Here is an exercise. Underline all adverbs in your last text.</p>
        <p>Common ones like ‘very’ and ‘really’ you can delete immediately.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Mark Twain again:</p>
        <p>‘Substitute “damn” every time you’re inclined to write “very”; your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be.’</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Consider this sentence: </p>
        <p>‘He ran really fast to school.’</p>
        <p>Delete ‘really’. The result: ‘He ran fast to school’, which sounds factual but boring.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>We use adverbs to add emphasis to verbs.</p>
        <p>To exaggerate, imagine a lot of adverbial emphasis:</p>
        <p>‘He ran really very super fast to school.’</p>
        <p>We get the point. But it sounds like a child. </p>
        <p>Kids have a limited vocabulary. </p>
        <p>They don’t know many verbs and rely on a few common verbs to which they add or subtract emphasis with a few common adverbs. </p>
        <p>Bad writers and foreign-language beginners do the same.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <h2>Tackle the Verb</h2>
        <p>Solution 1: Delete weak adverbs like ‘very’ and ‘really’.</p>
        <p>Solution 2: Choose stronger adverbs. </p>
        <p>Both steps already improve your text <del>very much</del> tremendously.</p>
        <p>Solution 3 is even better: Tackle the weak verb.</p>
        <p>Use a stronger verb. Then no adverb needs to strengthen the weak verb.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>‘He ran very fast to school.’</p>
        <p>Solution 1: ‘He ran fast to school.’</p>
        <p>Solution 2: ‘He ran briskly / swiftly to school.’</p>
        <p>Solution 3: ‘He sprinted to school.’ To run fast = to sprint.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>For more emphasis to the verb, add data or a metaphor.</p>
        <p>‘He sprinted 2 minutes to school.’</p>
        <p>‘He drove 50 km/h in a 30 zone.’</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>A basic rule of storytelling: Show, don’t tell.</p>
        <p>Go for figures of speech, also known as metaphors.</p>
        <p>‘He sprinted like Usain Bolt to school.’</p>
        <p>‘He flew like a rocket to school.’</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>The choice of metaphor reflects your personality and connection to the reader. It makes writing unique.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>‘The stock market declined very much.’ (weak adverb)</p>
        <p>‘The stock market declined dramatically.’ (stronger adverb, but overused)</p>
        <p>‘The stock market collapsed.’ (stronger verb)</p>
        <p>‘The stock market fell to the ground.’ (metaphor)</p>
        <p>‘The stock market fell by 18%.’ (data)</p>
        <p>Pick the shortest, strongest verb, add precise data, or paint a picture.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>98.25% of adverbs are evil. <del>Approximately</del>.</p>
        <p>Exceptions prove the rule!</p>
        <p>Sometimes, a strong adverb adds spicy flavour.</p>
        <p>But make it a conscious choice. </p>
