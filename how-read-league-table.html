        <h1>How to read the league table</h1>
        <p>The league table does not lie, football wisdom says, but the table only tells us the truth at the end of the season. The early season does lie a lot!</p>
        <p>To review the basics: A league table counts cumulative points after cumulative rounds of matches, so the significance of the league table is cumulative too.</p>
        <p>Being 1st after 12 games means less than being 1st after 22 games. A 3-point gap after 12 games is relatively a smaller gap than a 3-point gap after 22.</p>
        <p>A simple method of measuring the significance of the table is the percentage of games played.</p>
        <img src="img/league-table-percent.png" alt="League table significance in per cent of games played">
        <p>After 2 of 38 games, the season is 5.3% old. And so the table after 2 games is about 5.3% relevant.</p>
        <p>After 19 games played, at half-time, which usually falls into the period between Christmas and New Year’s, the ranking begins to make sense.</p>
        <p>Personally, however, I hesitate to take the league table too seriously until match-day 25 or 26, when two-thirds of the season have been played.</p>
        <p>If percentage figures seem too abstract, then consider the league season in terms of a 90-minute football match.</p>
        <img src="img/league-table-minutes.png" alt="League table compared to 90 minute football game">
        <p>9 games played in a 38-game season amounts to 23.7%. Transferred to a 90-minute game, 23.7% is the equivalent of being in the 21st minute of a match.</p>
        <p>When a team is 1-0 up after 21 minutes most football fans know that a lot of football still needs to be played, and a lot could happen. It would be pre-mature to celebrate winning the match.</p>
        <p>After 26 games, or in the 62nd minute, confidence might grow, but few fans would celebrate this early. Yet, maybe because the league season operates on a larger time-scale and humanity is impatient, every year some fans and pundits already feel like calling title or relegation favourites after 26 games or so.</p>
        <p>In short: Try to ignore the league table until January!</p>
